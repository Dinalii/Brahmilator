# Client-side of the Brahmilator

Brahmilator has a React-Native client-side component which is fully configured for Android Platform. In order to maximize the efficiency of the pre - process module React-Native has been configured with OpenCV as a native module.

## Configuration between React-Native and OpenCV

Pre-process module uses the deviceâ€™s camera to take a photo, processes it with native code and returns the processed image as a Base64 String. Doing it in plain JavaScript would be highly ineffective.

01. Download the OpenCV Android SDK
02. Extract the zip file
03. Open Android Studio and open the 'android' folder inside your React Native project
04. File > New > Import Module
05. Select `OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk/java`
06. Change module name to `OpenCV452` and untick all the options on the next screen
07. From top left, change the display from Android to Project
08. Open `build.gradle` of opencv module
09. Change `apply plugin: 'com.android.application'` to `apply plugin: 'com.android.library'`
10. Delete this line `applicationId: "org.opencv"`
11. File > Project Structure and click on Dependencies on the left side
12. Select app and click on + then Module Dependency and select opencv
13. Create a folder inside `android/app/src/main/` named jniLibs
14. Copy the contents of `OpenCV-android-sdk/sdk/native/libs` to **jniLibs**
15. If you are using `react-native-camera` your app will not build. To fix this add `multiDexEnabled true` under defaultConfig inside `android/app/build.gradle`
16. Now follow from Step 7 to end from [this blog](https://brainhub.eu/library/opencv-react-native-image-processing/)
17. After you are done open `RNOpenCvLibraryModule.java`
18. Whatever function you write under `@ReactMethod` will be accessible from Javascript
19. Example
```
public void toGrayscale(String imageAsBase64, Callback errorCallback, Callback successCallback) { 
   try {
     // do your stuff here like Imgproc.cvtColor(mat, mat, Imgproc.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
     // to return your processed image back to js use the following line
     successCallback.invoke(abc); 
   }
   catch (Exception e) {
            errorCallback.invoke(e.getMessage()); 
        }
}
```
20. Inside the React-Native
```
OpenCV.toGrayScale(img, (e) => console.log(e), (img) => {
    // do whatever you want with the processed img
  })
```
