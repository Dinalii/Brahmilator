# MobileNet Image Classification Model

Main purpose of the data science component of the proposed system is to read and recognize Brahmi letters from the inscription plates. There were two methods suggested to perform the said process of recognizing Brahmi characters. First one is using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model and the Second suggestion was using an Image Classification CNN model. Since the availability of proper arranged data set of Brahmi letter images, it was clear that using an image classifier of deep CNN is easier than using an OCR model, because the data set would have to be recreated from the scratch to train an OCR model. 
There are several classification models out there which are able to do the said process  above. The selected solution is “MobileNets”. These are pre-trained (ImageNet data set) deep CNN models which have reliable accuracy as well as good efficiency. It is also a light model not like VG16 model. Because of that it was easy to implement the model. MobileNet model had to be retrained with our data set since It is a pre-trained model.
